Used Python code to explore and analyze data collected by SleepInc's sleep-tracking app in order to identify lifestyle, health, and demographic factors that most strongly correlate with poor sleep quality. Based on the results of my analysis, I made conclusions about which factors most strongly correlate with poor sleep quality and made recommendations for people who would like to get a better night's sleep.

Used yfinance, beautifulsoup, and requests libraries to extract stock data and store in a pandas dataframe. This allowed me to explore and visualize the data in Python.
